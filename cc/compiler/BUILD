"""Config settings for compilers identified by Bazel.

Targets that require compiler-specific flags can use the config_settings defined
in this package in their select() statements.

*Note*: Before Bazel 6, gcc on Linux and clang on macOS would not match their
specific config_setting, but only the fallback case of a select expression.

Toolchains not shipped with Bazel are encouraged to use the same names to
identify compilers as used below, but this is not enforced.

Example:

  cc_binary(
    name = "foo",
    srcs = ["foo.cc"],
    copts = select({
        "//cc/compiler:gcc": [...],
        "//cc/compiler:clang": [...],
        "//cc/compiler:msvc-cl": [...],
        # Fallback case for an undetected compiler.
        "//conditions:default": [...],
    }),
  )

If multiple targets use the same set of conditionally enabled flags, this can be
simplified by extracting the select expression into a Starlark constant.
