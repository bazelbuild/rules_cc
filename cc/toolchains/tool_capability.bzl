For example, not all linkers support --start-lib, so to handle this, we write:

```
load("//cc/toolchains:args.bzl", "cc_args")
load("//cc/toolchains:tool.bzl", "cc_tool")

cc_tool(
    name = "clang",
    src = "@host_tools/bin/clang",
    capabilities = [
        "//cc/toolchains/capabilities:supports_start_end_lib",
    ],
)

cc_args(
    name = "pic",
    requires = ["//cc/toolchains/capabilities:supports_start_end_lib"],
    args = ["-Wl,--start-lib"],
)
```

This ensures that `-Wl,--start-lib` is added to the command-line only when using
a tool that supports the argument.


`cc_target_capability` rules cannot be listed in a
[`cc_feature.implies`](#cc_feature-implies) list, or in
[`cc_toolchain.enabled_features`](#cc_toolchain-enabled_features).

Note: Because `cc_tool` rules are always evaluated under the exec
configuration, a `select()` to guide capabilities will `select()` on the
properties of the exec configuration. If you need a capability that is
conditionally guided by the target configuration, prefer using configurabilty
constructs to enable the feature at the
[`cc_toolchain.enabled_features`](#cc_toolchain-enabled_features) level.
